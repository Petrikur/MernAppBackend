# MernAppBackend

# Project

This this an application which i am developing to learn more about full-stack development with MERN stack and many libraries to learn about authentication, authorization, file upload, apis, and many more.
This is the NodeJS(Express) part of the app. Frontend part can be found [here](https://github.com/Petrikur/MernAppReact).

In the app you can upload places with image and see other users places which they uploaded. It uses google maps api and geolocation api to convert address to location in map.
You can also edit your own places and delete them.

## Usage

My free tier hosting has ended so app cant be tested right now.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install dependencies to this app. Be sure to have backend running.

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```
